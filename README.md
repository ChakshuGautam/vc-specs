# Introduction

Schemas in this repo are for verifiable credentials in the areas of skilling, education, and work/job mostly (we may add some adjacencies as well). These implementations fully leverages [W3C VC specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and whenever possible reuses or derives from globally available schemas. Given India's large and diverse needs, these are adapted for that purpose to provide clarity to implementers. These specifications are created by the [Sunbird](https://sunbird.org/) OSS community and used in India in various domains such as education, skilling, and work.
